# Technical-Writing-Examples
These are a few examples of my ability to document software from 2019 for employers to see. These are files comprising a program
for the C++ language, showcasing how I document object oriented programs. My documentation skills are not limited 
to this type of C++ program or even C++ itself. The a11 files represent a C++ program that creates a class to represent the 
mathematical concept of a fraction. The program creates fractions, compares them, and performs arithmetic operations on them.
