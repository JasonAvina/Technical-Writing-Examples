# Technical-Writing-Examples
These are a few examples of my ability to document software from 2019 for employers to see. These are files comprising a program
for the C++ language, showcasing how I document object oriented programs. My documentation skills are not limited 
to this type of C++ program or even C++ itself. The files in this repository are a program that creates a class to represent the 
mathematical concept of a fraction. The program creates fractions, compares them, and performs arithmetic operations on them. The
intended audience for this type of technical writing is other programmers, but due to the simple nature of these programs I try
to make the documenation readable to anyone.
